               <!--Insert Image here-->
               <p><strong>Doug & Sherri Bean</strong> fell in love over a cup of coffee. Their first date was in this little coffee shop in their college town. They both were majoring in business and after they were married opened up The Coffee Cafe. Their siblings and family always came in to help out in the early days of the business, and still pop in today from time to time. They have two boys: Tom & Craig.</p>
